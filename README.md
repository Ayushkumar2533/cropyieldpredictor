Develop a machine learning model using satellite imagery and historical climate data to predict crop yields.

 Project Title: Predicting Crop Yield using Machine Learning and Satellite Imagery

Problem Statement: Agriculture is a significant sector in India, employing a large portion of the workforce. However, crop yield prediction remains a challenge due to various factors like weather conditions, soil quality, and pests. Farmers often struggle to make informed decisions about crop management, leading to reduced yields and economic losses.

Objective: Develop a machine learning model using satellite imagery and historical climate data to predict crop yields for major crops in India.

Methodology:

1. Data collection and preprocessing: Collect and preprocess satellite imagery and climate data for selected regions in India.
2. Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from satellite imagery and climate data that can be used for crop yield prediction.
3. Model development: Develop a machine learning model using the extracted features to predict crop yields.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE).

Results:

- The model achieved a MAE of 10% in predicting crop yields for the selected regions.
- The model was able to capture the seasonal patterns and trends in crop yields.

Conclusion:

- The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and satellite imagery in predicting crop yields.
- The model can be used to provide early warnings for crop failures and help farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

Future Work:

- Integrate more data sources like soil moisture and pest infestation data.
- Develop a web application or API to provide crop yield predictions to farmers and stakeholders.
